# software articles

Articles and videos on software that I like.

- [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)

  One of my favorites. Perhaps the best guideline to follow when thinking about
  how to structure a program of any size.
  
- [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell/)

  Another one of my favorites. Gives a practical example of using many of the
  concepts outlined in
  [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries).

- [Writing Python like it's Rust](https://kobzol.github.io/rust/python/2023/05/20/writing-python-like-its-rust.html)

  Rust forces you to write software in a (arguably) better way. This describes
  some ways to make Python more Rust-like. **TL;DR** Use type hints in abundance
  and make illegal states unrepresentable in your code.
