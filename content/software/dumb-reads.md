# dumb reads

Try to make your reads as dumb as possible. If the queries to generate your
views are complicated, it's probably safe to say there's some business logic
in there that could be captured in a more robust write model and then saved in
a way that makes the read dumb. Different people will obviously have different
interpretations for "dumb", but I still think this is something to strive for.
