# on documentation

**accurate >= none > wrong**

- Accurate documentation saves work.
- No documentation indicates that you'll need to put the work in to understand. 
- Wrong documentation misleads.

Sometimes no documentation is as good as accurate if the thing can be understood
quickly.

It's amazing how quickly accurate documentation can become wrong. Possibly
unpopular opinion - don't document your code until it's reasonably stabilized.
Instead spend that time writing clearer code that may never need to be
documented.
