# maintaining sourdough starter

## ingredients

- 1 part starter (20%)
- 4 parts water (80%)
- 1 part whole wheat flour (20%)
- 4 parts all-purpose flour (80%)

## steps

1. Take what you need from your starter and put it in a fresh container (I use a
   mason jar). Discard the rest.
2. Add the water and stir to dissolve it.
3. Add the whole wheat flour and stir.
4. Add the all-purpose flour and stir until completely mixed. This can take some effort.
5. I like to wrap a rubber band around the container so I can see how much it's risen.

## notes

**If I'm going to use the starter:**

- 25g starter
- 100g water
- 25g whole wheat flour
- 100g all-purpose flour

Depending on the temperature, it'll be ready to use in ~6-8 hours.

**If I'm just maintaining the starter:**

- 10g starter
- 40g water
- 10g whole wheat flour
- 40g all-purpose flour

I'll let it sit out for a few hours, then I'll put it in the fridge. I usually
maintain it again every 1-2 weeks, but you could probably go longer - it's
pretty resilient.
