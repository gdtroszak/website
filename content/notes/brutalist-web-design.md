# notes on [Guidelines for Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)
- A website's materials are its content and the context in which it's consumed.
- A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design is raw in its focus on content,
  and prioritization of the website visitor.
- Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices.
  - By default, a website that uses HTML as intended and has no custom styling
    will be readable on all screens and devices.
  - Only the act of design can make the content less readable, though it can
    certainly make it more.
- Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks.
  - A website is a hypertext document that allows for two primary forms of
    interaction: navigating a link to another location, and submitting information
    back to a server.
- Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons.
  - A hyperlink has no analog in the real world. Since the dawn of the web,
    convention dictates a hyperlink use an underline to reveal its existence (which
    is a wonderful solution, since underlining has no place in modern typesetting).
  - Buttons, however, do have an analog in both the real world and computer
    programs. The browser being a computer program, it stands to reason that
    buttons rendered in a browser should look like buttons rendered on the computer
    operating system running said browser.
- The back button works as expected.
  - All browsers have a built-in button called the back button. This button
    is a form of “undo”, taking the user back to where they were before their last
    navigational click.
- View content by scrolling.
  - A website is neither a book nor a magazine. Because it's viewed in a
    browser, users can scroll the browser's viewport to read content that can't fit
    on one screen.
  - Scrolling also allows the visitor to consume content at their pace using a
    method they prefer. Like the back button, this can only be broken by intentional
    design and careless implementation.
- Decoration when needed and no unrelated content.
- Performance is a feature.
- Start with left-aligned black text on a white background, and to apply styling
  only to solve a specific problem.
- Tips:
  - Understand the semantic meaning of HTML elements.
  - Learn about typography.
  - Try designing for a small screen by default.
