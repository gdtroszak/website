# github composite actions

- Composite actions allow you to collect a series of workflow job steps into a
  single action which you can then run as a single job step in multiple workflows.
- In general, it is best to place reusable actions in their own repository. This:
  - Enhances discoverability
  - Simplifies versioning
  - Makes it easier to document
