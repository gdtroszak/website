# Choose Boring Technology

- Boring doesn't mean bad. Certainly don't choose boring and bad technology.
  Choose boring and good technology.
- The ratio of known unknowns/unknown unknowns is high in boring technology.
- The are many technical solutions to problems. But technology choices have
  long-term operational costs. If you're lucky enough to have something that's
  going to operate for a long time, the ease of operating the thing should
  vastly outweigh how easy it is to build the thing.
- Choose new technology if building something is prohibitively difficult with
  the current technology you're operating. But make sure to really think through
  why it's difficult to build with your current technology.
