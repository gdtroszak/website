**accurate >= none > wrong**

- Accurate documentation saves work.
- No documentation indicates that you'll need to put the work in to understand. 
- Wrong documentation misleads.

Sometimes no documentation is as good as accurate if the thing can be understood quickly. 

It's amazing how quicky accurate documentation can become wrong.
