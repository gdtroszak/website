Figure out what lifestyle you want. Then figure out how to make enough money to
live that lifestyle with the smallest time investment possible. Let how you'd
like to spend your time drive your lifestyle. It's fine if money is a byproduct
of how you choose to spend your time, but don't fall into the trap of letting it
drive your lifestyle.
